\title{Calculates a mean value for a nominated vector (vs), given
a set of weights (w). Returns the weighted mean of the absolute 
values of differences between vector values and a 'displacement' 
This could be used, e.g., to minimize the mean difference between  
temperature of origin for each sample, and temperate of a site.}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{vs}{- genotype matrix (individuals, loci)}

\item{w}{- vector of weights}

\item{disp}{- opt value -- displacement from zero}
}
